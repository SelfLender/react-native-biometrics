React native biometrics is a simple bridge to native iOS and Android keystore management.  It allows you to create public private key pairs that are stored in native keystores and protected by biometric authentication.  Those keys can then be retrieved later, after proper authentication, and used to create a cryptographic signature.

## React Native Compatibility

| `react-native-biometrics` version | Required React Native Version |
|:---------------------------------:|:-----------------------------:|
| `>= 3.0.0`                        | `>= 0.60`                     |
| `<= 1.7.0`                        | `<= 0.59.x`                   |

## Getting started

using either Yarn:

`yarn add react-native-biometrics`

or npm:

`$ npm install react-native-biometrics --save`

### Install pods

`$ npx pod-install`

### Link / Autolinking

On React Native 0.60+ the [CLI autolink feature](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli/blob/master/docs/autolinking.md) links the module while building the app.

## Additional configuration

#### iOS

This package requires an iOS target SDK version of iOS 10 or higher

Ensure that you have the `NSFaceIDUsageDescription` entry set in your react native iOS project, or Face ID will not work properly.  This description will be presented to the user the first time a biometrics action is taken, and the user will be asked if they want to allow the app to use Face ID.  If the user declines the usage of face id for the app, the `isSensorAvailable` function will indicate biometrics is unavailable until the face id permission is specifically allowed for the app by the user.

#### Android

This package requires a compiled SDK version of 29 (Android 10.0) or higher

## Usage

This package is designed to make server authentication using biometrics easier.  Here is an image from https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2015/10/new-in-android-samples-authenticating.html illustrating the basic use case:

![react-native-biometrics](/assets/biometricsdiagram.png)

When a user enrolls in biometrics, a key pair is generated.  The private key is stored securely on the device and the public key is sent to a server for registration.  When the user wishes to authenticate, the user is prompted for biometrics, which unlocks the securely stored private key.  Then a cryptographic signature is generated and sent to the server for verification.  The server then verifies the signature.  If the verification was successful, the server returns an appropriate response and authorizes the user.

## Biometry Types

### TouchID (iOS only)

A constant for the touch id sensor type, evaluates to `'TouchID'`

__Example__

```js
import ReactNativeBiometrics, { BiometryTypes } from 'react-native-biometrics'

const rnBiometrics = new ReactNativeBiometrics()

const { biometryType } = await rnBiometrics.isSensorAvailable()

if (biometryType === BiometryTypes.TouchID) {
  //do something fingerprint specific
}
```

### FaceID (iOS only)

A constant for the face id sensor type, evaluates to `'FaceID'`

__Example__

```js
import ReactNativeBiometrics, { BiometryTypes } from 'react-native-biometrics'

const rnBiometrics = new ReactNativeBiometrics()

const { biometryType } = await rnBiometrics.isSensorAvailable()

if (biometryType === BiometryTypes.FaceID) {
  //do something face id specific
}
```

### Biometrics (Android only)

A constant for generic Biometrics, evaluates to `'Biometrics'`

__Example__

```js
import ReactNativeBiometrics, { BiometryTypes } from 'react-native-biometrics'

const rnBiometrics = new ReactNativeBiometrics()

const { biometryType } = await rnBiometrics.isSensorAvailable()

if (biometryType === BiometryTypes.Biometrics) {
  //do something
}
```

## Class

## Constructor

__Options Object__
| Parameter | Type | Description | iOS | Android |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| allowDeviceCredentials | boolean | Boolean that will enable the ability for the device passcode to be used instead of biometric information. On iOS, the prompt will only be shown after biometrics has failed twice. On Android, the prompt will be shown on the biometric prompt and does not require the user to attempt to use biometrics information first. Note: This feature is not supported on Android versions prior to API 30. | ✔ | ✔ |

__Example__

```js
import ReactNativeBiometrics from 'react-native-biometrics'

const rnBiometrics = new ReactNativeBiometrics({ allowDeviceCredentials: true })

// Perform operations as normal
// All prompts will allow for fallback to the device's credentials for authentication

```

      console.log(signature)
      verifySignatureWithServer(signature, payload)
    }
  })
```

### simplePrompt(options)

Prompts the user for their fingerprint or face id. Returns a `Promise` that resolves if the user provides a valid biometrics or cancel the prompt, otherwise the promise rejects.

**NOTE: This only validates a user's biometrics.  This should not be used to log a user in or authenticate with a server, instead use `createSignature`.  It should only be used to gate certain user actions within an app.

__Options Object__

| error | string | An error message indicating why the biometric prompt failed. `undefined` if there is no error. |

__Example__

```js
import ReactNativeBiometrics from 'react-native-biometrics'

const rnBiometrics = new ReactNativeBiometrics()

rnBiometrics.simplePrompt({promptMessage: 'Confirm fingerprint'})
  .then((resultObject) => {
    const { success } = resultObject

    if (success) {
      console.log('successful biometrics provided')
    } else {
      console.log('user cancelled biometric prompt')
    }
  })
  .catch(() => {
    console.log('biometrics failed')
  })
```

### Troubleshooting

- Because of this library's dependency on `androidx.biometric:biometric:1.0.0` it can cause transitive dependency resolution to change on certain version of React Native and `androidx.swiperefreshlayout` may no longer be able to be resolved.  This can be fixed by adding an explicit dependency on the library in your `android/app/build.gradle`:

    ```
    dependencies {
        implementation fileTree(dir: "libs", include: ["*.jar"])
        implementation "com.facebook.react:react-native:+"  // From node_modules
        implementation "androidx.swiperefreshlayout:swiperefreshlayout:1.0.0" // temp fix
        ...
    }
    ```

- There is a [known issue](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56700680/keychain-query-always-returns-errsecitemnotfound-after-upgrading-to-ios-13) on the iOS 13.x simulators where keys generated with access control flags cannot be queried and found properly.  This results in key not found errors in `biometricKeysExist` and `createSignature` on those simulators.  However, it works correctly on actual devices running iOS 13.
